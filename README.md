### Hi there, I'm Hans - aka [hkimchii] 👋

## I'm a Husband, Business Owner, Aspiring Developer, and a Forever Learner!

- 👔 I'm a small business owner by day, and a student by night, learning something new everyday!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning frontend web development, doing the basics of HTML, CSS & JS. I hope to move into other programming languages when I feel comfortable with JS.
- ☕ I love coffee and visiting new cafes with my wife. We have instagram dedicated to our cafe hopping! [<img alt="hkimchii | Instagram" width="22px" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2111/2111463.png" />][instagram] <--- Check it out! 😁
- 📷 Photography is another secret hobby of mine [<img alt="hkimchii | Instagram" width="22px" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2111/2111463.png" />][instagram2]
